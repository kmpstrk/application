# My Notes Application

My Notes App is a simple and intuitive application where users can add, delete, edit, and read notes.
It provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, offering a practical tool for organizing personal notes.
The app is utilizing a modern web development stack, including **Node.js, GraphQL, Express, MongoDB,** and **Apollo Client** for the backend, and **React, TypeScript, HTML, CSS**, and **Bootstrap** for the frontend.

## Technology Stack
### Backend:
* Node.js: A JavaScript runtime used to build the server-side logic.
* GraphQL: A query language for APIs, providing efficient data fetching and manipulation.
* Express: A minimalist web framework for Node.js that handles server requests and routing.
* MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing notes.
### Frontend:
* React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces and managing the frontend logic.
* Apollo Client: A comprehensive state management library for JavaScript, designed to integrate with GraphQL APIs.
* TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that helps catch errors early during development.
* HTML/CSS: Used for the basic structure and styling of the application.
* Bootstrap: A front-end framework used to ensure responsive design and consistent UI components.
